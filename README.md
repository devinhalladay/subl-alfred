Subl for Alfred
===========

*Alfred, please open file or folder in Sublime.*

The default keyboard shortcut is ⇧⌥⌘S but Alfred is a picky little bastard, so he'll probably erase that. Put it back   and then you should be good to select a file or folder in Finder and hit ⇧⌥⌘S to open that file or folder in Sublime.
